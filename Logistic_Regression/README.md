### Project Overview

 This project is going to predict the Insurance claim using logistic regression. The dataset contains information on the insurance claim. each observation is different policyholder with various features like the age of the person, the gender of the policyholder, body mass index, providing an understanding of the body, number of children of the policyholder, smoking state of the policyholder and individual medical costs billed by health insurance.


### Learnings from the project

 This project gives a better understanding of how to build a logistic regression model. In this project, you will apply the following concepts.

1. Train-test split
2. Correlation between the features
3. Logistic Regression
4. Auc score
5. Roc AUC plot


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 - Data loading and splitting in to train and test data
- Plotting the box plot to check for the outliers
- Correlation check using pair plot for feature vs feature
- Check the count_plot for different features vs target variable for categorical features
- Using logistic regression to predict the insurance claim
- Select the best model by cross-validation using Grid Search
- Check the performance of the classifier using roc auc curve
