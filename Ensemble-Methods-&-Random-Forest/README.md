### Project Overview

 Determine if the instance is a crater or not a crater. 1=Crater, 0=Not Crater

Note: This dataset was generated using HRSC nadir panchromatic image h0905_0000 taken by the Mars Express spacecraft. The images is located in the Xanthe Terra, centered on Nanedi Vallis and covers mostly Noachian terrain on Mars. The version used is a preprocessed data, converted in to numerical features using matplotlib.img library




### Learnings from the project

 DIfferent Ensemble Methods:
1. Voting Classifier
2. Bagging
3. Pasting
4. Random Forest


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 1. Load the dataset and see how it looks like. Additionally, split it into train and test set and standardize the data
2. Predict the values after building  different  Machine learning models namely Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Bagging Classifier etc and choose the best model
